The repository ccvers the problem statement related to "Will The Customer Accept the Coupon?"

This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that contains the analysis using panda and vsisulaization to find the condition when Customer will accept the Coupon.

In the findings, different coupon group options was explored. To start the analysis first I read the data.csv as dataframe and then work on finding the missing and duplicate records. 

In the analysis it was found that the missing and duplicate records are very less compared to total records. So I removed the rows with missing values and duplicate data. 

Then the focus to filter the data Bar Coupon. Based on the analysis and investigation done on "Bar" Coupon. The overall acceptance proportion on Bar Coupon was found 

It is observed that driver who visited bar more than once in a month, with no kid as passenger, occupation other than farming, fishing and forestry and above age 25 has most desirable chance to accept the bar coupon. Althought the acceptance rate for Bar Coupon in that condition is 5.8% of total count of Bar Coupon available. 

In the further investigation on "Coffee House" coupon, It is observed that driver who visited coffee house more than once in a month, with no snowy weather, with occupation other than farming, fishing and forestry and above age 21 has highest chance to accept the coffee House Coupon. In this case the acceptance rate for Coffee House coupon is 21% of total count of Coffee House available.
